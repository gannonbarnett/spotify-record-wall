# Spotify Record Wall
I like sharing cool stuff with my friends, like books on a bookshelf or art on walls. 
I want to make something physical to share what I've been listening to recently. I think
people used to do this with a record collection, but now that tunes are just mere bytes it's 
not so easy. 

*this repo is a wip*
